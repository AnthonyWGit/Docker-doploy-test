<p style='text-align:center; padding:1rem;'>I'm learning Docker ! This is an image of my first app. It feels kinda weird to use native PHP again after so
much time spent on frameworks, but i'm actually enjoing it. It's a small test project so there won't be much to this like additionnal JS or CSS.</p>
